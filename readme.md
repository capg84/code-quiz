## Aboud the Code Quiz
I have used `html`, `css` and `js` for the Code Quiz to perform properly. While I have used `html` and `css` for the basic structure of the pages, `js` was used for most of the actions on the pages. The main purposes `js` was used are for:

* Storing the questions and answers in an array,
* Creating the required variable, constants and functions,
* Loading the questions and the answers randomly from the array,
* Storing the top 5 scores

### Rules of the quiz
The rules of the quiz are displayed on the homepage of the quiz. The rules I have defined are:

* The players will have 4 questions to answer (from a question bank of 5, which is managed by the `quiz.js` file),
* Total time is 100 seconds for 4 questions,
* For each correct answer, the player will be awarded 25 points,
* For each incorrect answer, the player will be penalised by 10 seconds from the total time left,
* Once the quiz is started, the player cannot pause or reset the timer without restarting the quiz.
